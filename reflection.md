Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

So far, inheritance is really cool to work with because you don't have to reimplement the same methods and attributes over and over again for each class. Having a broaded framework, then specifying with subclasses is a lot easier to work with.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

It was a challenging to get the house subclass to compile at first. I would advise someone taking the course in the future to take this assignment slowly, making sure to compile the parent class first and check how each class runs as you go, little by little. It is important to check if things work along the way, rather than find out they don't run correctly after spending a lot of time coding.
